I submit the folder "java" from my project because i think it's the most related folder to the submission since i only change CalculatorStateHolder.kt for the logic and MainActivity.kt for the UI. I only use the UI from the last task that was from the basics codelab so the looks is so simple but atleast the positioning is settled you can change the layout all you want either its portrait or landscape since i already make it pretty dynamic.

This is blank template with the exception of this readme. You are free to push anything to this repo that are related to the homework. 

For qualifying for a full grade you just need:
- Fully working basic calculator: +, -, *, /
- Some extra of a   scientific calculator: 1x, x!, x^y, sqrt(x), sin(x), cos(x), tan(x), inv(sin(x)), inv(cos(x)), inv(tan(x)), log(x), ln(x)
- Acceptable enough UI placement
